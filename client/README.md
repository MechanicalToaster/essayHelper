# essayHelper

## WIP project
The goal is to create a website to help my child (and other Elementary School age children) with writing full essays.
The initial front end of the site is halfway finished, and is usable for baseline typing and editing.
The ultimate goal is for this website to be usable by anyone writing essays at any level.

### TODO:
1. [ ] Develop/Implement back end for full CRUD functionality
2. [ ] Button to add/delete additional sections/paragraphs
3. [ ] Ability to save progress
4. [ ] Navbar + menu
5. [ ] 'Export as' button. Initial use will likely just compile Paragraph Fields into a singular text box for C/P
6. [ ] Login features
7. [ ] 'Add Reference' button
8. [ ] Improve 'Export as' to export as a variety of text documents, with appropriate formating
9. [ ] Further improvements to allow adjustment of formating requirements (such as margins, spacing, etc) prior to export
